# Inflation in France: CPI or HICP?

This repository provides replication codes for the [linked note](https://fgeerolf.com/CPI-or-HICP.pdf), as well as tools to calculate constant euro evolutions based on the HICP rather than the CPI.

## Replication

The repository contains everything needed to replicate the figures and data from the [linked note](https://fgeerolf.com/CPI-or-HICP.pdf):

### Table 1. Inflation according to the CPI or the HICP
